/// fm-20260925-14: does a deliberate decoder prompt **pair** with "long pauses
/// end the sentence"?
///
/// The pause fix alone regresses the English control (with no decoder prompt the
/// switch on invents a fragment the switch off does not produce), so the switch
/// ships off. This measures the pairing the other way round: the switch on with
/// a deliberate decoder prompt as the arm, and the **switch-off/none** arm — the
/// app as it ships today — as the baseline every arm is diffed against, word by
/// word. A prompt that fixes the punctuation by changing the words is not a win,
/// so the deltas are words, not marks.
///
/// Opt-in twice over, exactly like the pause measurement: `OSW_TEST_CAPTAIN_RECORDINGS`
/// has to name the directory and a multilingual model has to be available. With
/// either missing the cases skip, which is the state CI runs in.
///
/// The arms, per recording:
///
/// * `off / none` — the control: today's app. Everything else is a delta against it.
/// * `on / none`, `on / attributed`, `on / c1 (pl)`, `on / c2 (pl)`,
///   `on / c3 (pl, no commas)`, `on / c1 EN` — the switch on with each prompt.
/// * `off / attributed`, `off / c1 (pl)`, `off / c1 EN` — the prompt on its own,
///   so a change can be attributed to the prompt rather than the switch.
/// * `on / none`, decoded twice, as the determinism anchor.
///
/// Everything judgemental (which prompt is better, which one is clean) is
/// **reported**, not asserted; the assertions are the structural ones — the
/// engine's transcript is the assembler's output and no long pause is left inside
/// a sentence on an `on` arm.
