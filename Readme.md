## Features

- 🎙️ Real-time audio recording and transcription
- 🧠 Two transcription engines: [Whisper](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) and [Parakeet](https://github.com/AntinomyCollective/FluidAudio) — download models directly from the app
- ⌨️ Global keyboard shortcuts — key combination or single modifier key (e.g. Left ⌘, Right ⌥, Fn)
- 🖱️ Mouse button trigger — bind the middle or an extra (thumb) mouse button to start/stop recording
- ✊ Hold-to-record mode — hold the shortcut, modifier key or mouse button to record, release to stop
- 📁 Drag & drop audio files for transcription with queue processing
- 🎤 Microphone selection — switch between built-in, external, Bluetooth and iPhone (Apple Continuity) mics from the menu bar
- 🌍 Support for multiple languages with auto-detection
- 🇯🇵🇨🇳🇰🇷 Asian language autocorrect ([autocorrect](https://github.com/huacnlee/autocorrect))

### Added by this fork

- 🌐 **Local tone and clean-up, in the language you spoke** — an instruction-tuned model runs inside the app
  (llama.cpp linked in, no server, no port); two independent switches, off by default. The transcript is rewritten
  in place: **the app never changes the language of your dictation**
- 🇵🇱 **Tone rewrites run on Qwen3-8B when it is installed, in both languages** — clean-up alone keeps the
  language preference (Polish prefers the 8B, English always runs the shipped 1.5B). The card says which model
  each job uses and what it costs in RAM. Nothing is refused, nothing is substituted silently
- 🛡️ **A rewrite that answers instead of rewriting never reaches your text** — a deterministic guard rejects an
  assistant frame ("Sure,", "Oczywiście,"), a label line, the prompt's own `TRANSCRIPT`/`TRANSKRYPCJA`
  delimiter, a stub or a language flip, and pastes your own words with a notice instead. It reads text only:
  no second model call, so it cannot invent anything itself
- 🧭 **Auto-detected language, always** — the engine measures the language of every utterance (no language
  picker); a transcript nothing can place is pasted raw, untouched
- 🛡️ **English-only model guard, and a second reading of the same audio** — an `.en` model cannot detect
  anything, so when the transcript it produced is not English the app says so and offers the multilingual model
  instead of keeping the invented text; and because fluent English over Polish speech *is* English, the same
  recording is decoded a second time with the decoder prompt flipped, and a transcript the second reading does
  not contain is refused the same non-destructive way (numbers in §3)
- 🧹 **Dictation clean-up** — filler words, `hmm`, `aaa` and stutters are scrubbed, punctuation, articles and word
  order repaired, all in the language that was spoken, through the same single transform call
- 📚 **Reference / glossary field** — names and terms fed into the transform prompt
- ⌨️ **Keystroke delivery** — the transcript is typed into the focused app as synthetic keystrokes, which no
  keyboard layout changes and which leave the clipboard alone; a Citrix session, a virtual machine or a remote
  desktop, where keystrokes arrive as key codes instead of text, gets it through a clipboard paste that restores
  what was there (numbers in §5)
- 🔒 **Accessibility only** — Input Monitoring is no longer used or required anywhere, and no permission screen
  blocks the app
- 📊 **Last-dictation card** — the detected language and the raw, cleaned and final text of the last dictation
- 🗂️ **Model storage controls** — installed models listed with the one in use, SHA-256 verification against the
  digest each publisher reports, removal with the space it frees
- 🧯 **Long-form audio fix** — dictation longer than 30 s no longer skips audio
- ⏸️ **A long pause ends the sentence** — a switch (off by default, with the reason measured in §8) that keeps the
  pause the speaker left instead of dissolving it into a 0.1 s breath, so a pause cannot split a thought into a
  fragment or run two thoughts together — Polish in particular, where the model's punctuation is weaker than
  English's
- 🧾 **Readable settings, reachable settings** — the Settings sheet lays out correctly, and the status-bar menu
  reaches it even with the main window closed
- 📦 **One-package install, one-operation uninstall** — from inside the app
- 🛠️ **Developer tooling** — identity-signed builds whose permission grants survive rebuilds, one build script for
  the vendored engines, and a contract check for the installer

## What this fork changes

Written against the delivery branch `feat/local-translate-tone`, merge tip `319f3a3` (2026-09-24; this section
is its own commit). Every claim below was
checked against that tree, and the numbers were produced by running the code, not by reading it. To see the whole
delta yourself:

```shell
git fetch upstream        # upstream = https://github.com/Starmel/OpenSuperWhisper.git, already a remote here
git diff upstream/develop...feat/local-translate-tone
```

**Scale.** 54 commits of its own on top of `upstream/develop` (69 including merges), touching 78 files:
**+12,995 / −715** lines. 42 files are new, 35 are upstream files with changes, and one file moved
(`ggml-tiny.en.bin` into the app bundle directory). Those 42 new files — app sources, tests, build scripts,
packaging and the vendored `libllama/` — are the fork's own; everything else in the tree — the two engines, the
shortcuts, the queue, the model catalogue, the onboarding — is upstream's, edited where a feature required it.

Paths below are relative to `OpenSuperWhisper/` unless they start with `Scripts/`, `packaging/` or `libllama/`.

### 1. Tone and clean-up, inside the app — never a language change

Upstream transcribes; it has no notion of tone and no rewriting pass at all. This fork adds two independent
switches in **Settings → Transcription** ("Apply tone" and "Clean up dictation"), both riding one call to a model
that runs **inside the app**. The transcript is rewritten **in the language it was spoken in**: Polish stays
Polish, English stays English, and there is no direction change anywhere in the product.

The rewrite is performed **in-process** by one of two models. `Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-Q4_K_M` (~986 MB on disk,
~1.1 GB of RAM while loaded) is the model every language can run on; `Qwen3-8B-Q4_K_M` (~5 GB on disk,
~5.3 GB while loaded) is what a **tone rewrite prefers when it is installed — in both languages**, because
holding the content still while the register moves is the job the shipped model was measured getting wrong
(`fm-20260924-10`: added acknowledgements, preambles and invented nouns). Clean-up alone keeps the
language-based preference: Polish prefers the 8B, English always runs the shipped 1.5B. The shipped model does
the work for either job when the 8B is not installed, and the card says which one is in use. Each is
downloaded on demand into the app's own Application Support folder and verified against its pinned checksum
before it is used. llama.cpp is vendored as `libllama/` and linked into the app exactly like whisper.cpp, so
there is no background server, no listening port and no endpoint override: the transform
(`OpenSuperWhisper/TransformService.swift`) is the only way the text can be rewritten.

### 2. The language is auto-detected, and never changed

The decision is a table (`TransformPolicy` in `TransformService.swift`), not a per-call guess, and it is fed by the
language the speech engine reports *for that same utterance* — whisper's own detection, the only mode there is
now that the **Language picker is gone from Settings, onboarding and the menu bar** — or by the text heuristic in
`Utils/LanguageDetector.swift` (Polish diacritics, function words, bigrams) for engines that cannot report one,
such as Parakeet. `params.language` is always `nil` and `params.detectLanguage` stays `false`. The rules that
matter:

- The transcript is rewritten **in its own language**, always: there is no target language in the product, and no
  prompt that could move the text into another one.
- Both switches off is the default install: **no model call at all**, and the transcript is bit-for-bit what the
  engine produced.
- A transcript nothing could place (an engine that reports nothing, and a text too short for the heuristic) is
  pasted raw; no model is asked to guess its language.
- Tone no longer rides on anything: it is a same-language rewrite, so it needs no other switch to be on.

The full switch table is in [Tone and clean-up](#tone-and-clean-up-in-the-language-you-spoke) below.

### 3. English-only model guard, re-keyed to the transcript

An `.en` whisper model cannot detect a language at all, and with the language picker gone there is no setting left
to compare against — so the evidence is the text the model produced. `Utils/SpeechModelLanguageGate.swift` reads
the transcript with the same `LanguageDetector` heuristic the transform uses, and when an English-only model's
transcript is not English (the captain's own case: `ggml-tiny.en.bin` writing confident English over Polish
speech) the dictation is refused with a notice naming the model *and* what the dictation looks like, plus the
multilingual model already on the machine as a one-click remedy. English dictation can never be caught by it — and
that verdict is evidence only from **four words** up: measured on his recordings plus the repository's labelled
fixtures (122 labelled items), the heuristic agrees with the truth 36.4% of the time at one word, 54.2% at two,
79.2% at three, 92.9% at four to five and 100% at six to ten (one miss in the fourteen four-to-five-word items),
so below four words the gate refuses nothing — an English *Miami*, *nowadays* or *brownie*, every one of them read
as Polish, is dictated rather than refused.

**The half that heuristic cannot see is a comparison.** The two failures the app actually stored for him on
2026-09-25 — `I'll see you later. Bye!` and `I'm not going to be able to say that.…`, read out of his own
`recordings.sqlite`, over recordings of Polish speech — are English text, so the heuristic sees nothing wrong, and
the audio carried speech, so the no-speech refusal sees nothing wrong either. The same recording is therefore
decoded a **second time** and the reading itself is the evidence: same model, same audio, same settings, with
exactly one thing flipped — the decoder prompt decision (`WhisperEngine.secondReadingPrompt`: a transcription
that sent a prompt is read again with none, and one that sent none is read again with the default its language
has; an English-only model is English by construction). A transcript that only exists while the decoder has been
*handed text* is text the model wrote, not words it heard.

`SpeechModelLanguageGate.corroborationConflict` refuses when the second reading holds **under 70% of the
transcript's words and at least three of them are missing** (the floor is what keeps a three-word dictation from
being refused over one word; a script that writes without spaces is one word and is never judged). The floor and
the short-text guard are **chosen from the two measurements below** — the middle of the gap they leave, with the
upper margin against the worst reading the app's own path produced and the lower margin against the closest
invention the probe produced — not derived from anything.

**Through the app's own code path** (`SecondReadingOnRealAudioTests`, opt-in, the test host running the shipped
`WhisperEngine` and `SpeechModelLanguageGate` over the captain's recordings in
`~/Library/Application Support/ru.starmel.OpenSuperWhisper/recordings/`, read-only, with the multilingual model
installed on that machine, 2026-09-28): of the 27 files there, 9 carry audio and 8 produced a transcript long
enough to judge. Six corroborate **every** word; the two that do not are his English dictations at **96.1%**
(51 words) and **82.6%** (23 words, 4 words lost). **82.6%** is the worst legitimate reading measured on the
shipped path, and what the floor's upper margin is against.

**With `whisper-cli`** — the vendored whisper.cpp built as its own binary, a separate tool run outside the app,
so everything in this paragraph is a probe of the **model's** behaviour and not of the app's path — on the same
recordings and on the repo's fixtures: his Polish is word-for-word identical under seven configurations of the
same audio (greedy, sampling at temperature 0.4, beam search, no temperature fallback, the un-trimmed VAD path, a
prompt in the wrong language, the app's own prompt) — 35 pairs, no word lost; the long English fixture sits at
98.6% (280 words); and `ggml-tiny.en.bin` writing English over that same Polish speech shares **0%** of its words
with the second reading on four of the five recordings and **50%** on the fifth (the 2.4 s one, where it writes
"This is today." twice in a row). The two transcripts the app stored share **0%** with what `whisper-cli` reads
the same audio as today. **50%** is the closest an invention came to being corroborated, and what the floor's
lower margin is against.

**The probe is deterministic**: repeating one `whisper-cli` invocation twice gave byte-identical output in all
three invocations compared that way — the greedy decode of one recording, the temperature-0.4 decode of one
recording, and the English-only model with a prompt on one recording — so a disagreement is the model's, not the
sampling's.

So the floor leaves **12.6 points** above the worst legitimate reading (0.826, shipped path) and **20 points**
below the closest invention (0.500, probe). The false-refusal rate measured is **0 of the 8 judged readings
through the shipped path**, and separately **0 of the 35 legitimate configuration pairs** through the probe —
two populations, two rates, both zero. No second reading — no prompt to flip to, a decode that failed, a
transcript too short to judge — refuses nothing, and the refusal is the same non-destructive one as the two
above: no transcript row and nothing pasted, while the recording itself is kept as a failed row so it stays findable, and a message about the two readings that does not read like
either of the other refusals.

### 4. Dictation clean-up and the reference field

Two more controls in **Settings → Transcription**. **Clean up dictation** removes filler sounds, drawn-out
vowel runs, stutters and false starts, and repairs the sentence language (Polish affixes, casing, diacritics) —
deterministically in `Utils/DictationScrubber.swift`, and where grammar is at stake through the *same* single
transform call the tone already uses: measured on the captain's own recordings with the bundled model, clean-up
**adds no model call** where a tone rewrite is already happening (the clean-up wording travels inside that
prompt), and it adds exactly **one** call — median 0.17–0.38 s — where the app previously made none, which is a
dictation with clean-up on and the tone switch off. The deterministic scrub itself costs ~0.13 ms. **Reference** takes free text — names, product
terms, jargon — and passes it into that prompt so the model stops mangling them.

The last dictation is inspectable in the app: `DictationReport.swift` records the detected language plus the raw,
cleaned and final text, and the main window shows them side by side. History always keeps the raw transcript.

### 5. Delivery: synthetic keystrokes, and the clipboard for a redirected target

Upstream types the transcript by putting it on the system pasteboard and sending ⌘V
(`ClipboardUtil.insertText` / `sendCmdV`), which overwrites whatever the user had copied. This fork delivers by
synthesising the keystrokes instead (`Utils/KeyboardSimulator.swift`) — each chunk carrying its text in the event's
text field under a key code taken from the active layout — so no native target's clipboard is read or written, and the layout-dependent keycode translation is covered by `KeyboardSimulatorTests`.
Keystrokes that the system refuses to deliver are reported instead of being dropped silently. This also means
Accessibility — not Input Monitoring — is the grant that matters; see the next point.

The keystroke path is not, however, the whole story, and the day the captain dictated into a **Citrix session** and
read back spliced, repeated text is why. A synthetic key event carries its text in an Apple-specific field, and a
target that redirects input into another machine — a Citrix session, a virtual machine, a remote desktop — may
never look at that field: measured on this machine, the Citrix client's own viewer taps the keyboard events, reads
key codes and modifier flags, and links **no** Unicode-payload reader at all. So the session must rebuild
characters from key codes, under a keyboard layout this app neither controls nor knows. Two changes came out of
that (`Utils/TextDelivery.swift`, `Utils/KeyboardSimulator.swift`):

* **A chunk travels once, and carries a real key code.** Both events of a chunk's keyDown/keyUp pair used to
  carry the text. Carrying text on the release diverges from what the platform expects of a key pair, and it is a
  duplication hazard in any target that inserts what each event carries: every 20-unit window arrives twice, the
  second copy at the caret the first had already moved. The text is now on the keyDown only; the keyUp stays, and
  keeps the keyDown's key code, so a host tracking key state sees a release rather than a stuck key, and its
  Unicode field is *cleared* to length zero rather than left unset, because an unset field reads back as the
  character the key code makes. **This is a hazard removed, not a cause proven**: no capture of the failing
  target's event stream exists.
* **The key code is no longer hardcoded to 0.** Key code 0 is the `A` key on ANSI layouts, and a target that
  rebuilds characters from key codes used to type `a` once per chunk, because every chunk was posted on key 0. No
  line in the delivery path passes key code 0 any more: the code now comes from the active layout, for the chunk's
  first character (one event carries up to 20 characters, so the first is the honest choice), and a chunk the
  layout has no key for — all nine of `ą ć ę ł ń ó ś ź ż` are Option combinations on the layout active here, and
  CJK, Cyrillic and emoji have none — carries `0x7F`, a code the system defines no key for. The layout's modifiers
  are deliberately not sent with it: they would turn the event into an Option-modified key for every local
  application, and a redirected target re-reads them under its own layout anyway.
  **What this does not claim, because an independent audit of this change measured it otherwise**: key code 0 can
  still be *resolved*. On the layout active here (`com.apple.keylayout.PolishPro`) key 0 *is* the `A` key, so a
  chunk whose first character is `a` or `A` legitimately carries key code 0 next to its text. That is correct for
  a native macOS target — its text arrives in the event's Unicode field whatever the key code is — and it is a
  residual `a` once for that chunk in a target reached by keystrokes that ignores the field. The measured clients
  take the clipboard path instead, and **Delivery** in Settings overrides the whole rule; the key code choice
  alone cannot remove that residual, because one event carries up to 20 characters and can have only one key code.
* **The mechanism follows the target class** (`TextDelivery`): keystrokes into a native macOS application, and the
  clipboard paste for an application that redirects input elsewhere. The rule has two tiers and the difference
  between them is deliberate — one is measured here and one is not:
  * *measured* (`verifiedRemoteClientBundleIdentifiers`): the bundle identifiers read out of the installed and
    running applications on this machine — Citrix Viewer `com.citrix.receiver.icaviewer.mac` (seen frontmost,
    `active=true`, with a session up), the Workspace UI `com.citrix.receiver.nomas`, the engine
    `com.citrix.HdxRtcEngine`, Parallels Desktop, macOS Screen Sharing. A match here pastes;
  * *a judgement* (`remoteClientVendorPrefixes`): the same clients' vendor families — `com.citrix.`,
    `com.parallels.`, `com.teamviewer.`, VMware Fusion, VirtualBox, UTM, QEMU, Microsoft Remote Desktop, Jump
    Desktop, Screens, RealVNC, TigerVNC, AnyDesk, Parsec, RustDesk, Chrome Remote Desktop, NoMachine. An
    independent reading put "a prefix rule is safe" at **0.36**, so a prefix-only match **does not paste unless
    the user switches on** *Paste into other apps from these vendors* in Settings: an uncertain match fails
    toward the behaviour that does not touch the clipboard.
  **This is a deliberate change to the doctrine above**: "the clipboard is never used" is no longer
  unconditionally true. Accessibility insertion was rejected because a session exposes no host-side text element
  to write into, and real per-character key codes because they cannot reproduce arbitrary Unicode on a target
  whose layout is unknown.
* **The clipboard path's crash hole is closed on disk by `ClipboardRecovery`.** The previous contents are put
  back 1.5 s after the paste — proved on the machine's real pasteboard, byte-identical, in
  `DeliveryMeasurementTests` — but that restore is an in-process block, and a measurement showed what a process
  that dies inside that window leaves behind: the transcription on the clipboard and the user's own contents
  gone. So the displaced clipboard is written to `~/Library/Application Support/ru.starmel.OpenSuperWhisper/
  clipboard-recovery.plist` (`0600`, readable by that user alone) **before** the pasteboard is touched, and the
  next launch puts it back if the record is still there — proven in `ClipboardRecoveryTests`, which kills a child
  process built from the app's own code and then runs the same recovery entry point the launch runs. The record
  is cleared as soon as the delivery restores the clipboard itself, and recovery refuses to put anything back
  when the clipboard no longer holds this app's text. That refusal is content-based, not identity-based: it
  compares the digest of the text that is on the clipboard with the digest of the text the delivery wrote, so a
  third party who wrote the *byte-identical* transcription after a crash would still be overwritten. An
  independent audit measured that window and called it negligible; it is stated here rather than left implied.
* **What remains unclosed, stated rather than hidden.** A target that services the paste *later* than the restore
  gets the **restored** clipboard contents — the user's own previous clipboard pasted into their document instead
  of the dictation (measured case: `TextDeliveryTests`); an app killed between the copy and the restore keeps the
  transcription on the clipboard until the next launch puts the old contents back; and if the session has
  clipboard redirection switched off, the paste delivers **nothing at all** and this app cannot tell, because the
  only thing it can observe is its own pasteboard. `Settings → Transcription` offers **Delivery** (Automatic,
  Keystrokes only, Clipboard paste) plus the vendor toggle: "Keystrokes only" turns the clipboard path off
  entirely, and every dictation's unified-log line records `mechanism=`, the `target=` bundle identifier and
  whether the match was `match=verified-client` or `match=vendor-family`.

**Verified and not verified.** On this side: the events a delivery posts, the shape of the pair, the key code and
Unicode field each event carries, which mechanism the target rule selects for a given application and preference,
that ⌘V is posted, that the pasteboard holds the transcript and gets its previous contents back byte-identically,
what a target that services the paste late receives, and that a killed process's clipboard record is recovered on
the next run. That the text *arrives* is verified for a native macOS target, through a real `NSTextView` driven by
AppKit's own key bindings. It is **not** verified for a Citrix session: there is no session in the test suite and
nothing about a session is observable from the host — whether the session reads key codes rather than the event's
text field, and whether the paste lands at all (that one needs clipboard redirection enabled in the session), are
both open. Which bundle is in front during a real delivery *is* answered by the log line's `target=` and `match=`
fields on the next real dictation; the rest needs a probe inside the session.

**Installing it.** Nothing above reaches the running app until it is built and installed: `Scripts/dev-run.sh`
builds, signs with the local dev identity and runs `build/Build/Products/Debug/OpenSuperWhisper.app`;
`Scripts/install-and-verify.sh` packages it, backs up the user's data, replaces `/Applications/OpenSuperWhisper.app`
and verifies the installed copy. The grant the delivery needs is **Accessibility** (the app is not sandboxed and
its entitlements already carry it), and because the signer's designated requirement is what TCC matches against,
an install through those scripts keeps the existing grant — if macOS does ask, the app's own message says to
switch the Accessibility entry off and on once. Nothing in the delivery path needs a new permission, and no
Settings default has to be set for the measured Citrix bundles to get the clipboard.


### 6. Permissions: Accessibility only, and nothing blocks on it

Upstream's modifier monitor installs a `.listenOnly` event tap (`ModifierKeyMonitor.swift:142` in upstream's
tree), which is what made macOS demand **Input Monitoring**. This fork's tree contains no `IOHID` reference and no
listen-only tap: the event-related grant is Accessibility alone, and recording and typing work without a
permission screen. The app never
gates on permissions: missing ones surface as inline notices with a button that opens the right System Settings
pane, onboarding can be skipped, and **Settings → Shortcuts → Permissions** shows the state of both grants at any
time. A build left in Xcode's split debug-dylib layout — the state that makes a recorded grant stop matching — is
now detected and refused rather than launched.

### 7. Long-form dictation no longer loses audio

The most consequential bug fixed here, because it silently destroyed text in the path the app is used for. The
decoder was configured with `noTimestamps = !showTimestamps`, which is `true` by default, and without timestamps
whisper.cpp advanced its seek a full 30 s per window — discarding whatever it had not transcribed. A dictation
longer than a window therefore arrived with holes. The fork keeps the decoder's timestamps unconditionally
(`params.noTimestamps = false`, `Engines/WhisperEngine.swift:415`, with the rationale in place), so the seek
follows the audio the decoder actually covered.

Measured on the delivery tip against `large-v3-turbo`, in `LongFormTranscriptionTests`: **unique-word recall
0.9932 English** and **0.9873 Russian**, tail recall **1.0** in both languages, **0 replayed four-word runs**.
The transcripts are captured verbatim next to the measurement, and four independent derivations of the numbers
agree to the last printed digit.

### 8. A long pause ends the sentence

The pause was never ignored — it was **dissolved**. Decoding takes the silence-removed path
(`params.language = nil`, so `showTimestamps` decides only the `[t0->t1]` prefixes), and
`Engines/WhisperEngine.swift` rebuilt the speech-only audio by replacing **every** gap the VAD found with a fixed
**0.1 s of zeros** — the same 0.1 s upstream `whisper_full` uses when it stitches VAD segments
(`libwhisper/whisper.cpp/src/whisper.cpp:6730-6800`). A pause of any length therefore reached the decoder as a
breath, and `assembleSegmentTexts` joined the decoder's segments with `""`, so the VAD's own timing — the one
signal that survived — was discarded. The decoder then decided sentence boundaries from prosody alone, which is
enough in English and is not enough in Polish, where the model's punctuation is markedly weaker.

**The switch is named for what it does, not for what was asked.** One line in **Settings → Transcription →
Language Settings**: **Long Pauses End the Sentence** — "a pause of 0.6 s or longer keeps its silence and closes the
sentence, instead of dissolving into a breath that lets two thoughts merge". It ships **on by default**, paired with
a decoder prompt chosen by the language of the dictation, and the price of that pairing is stated in the switch's own
Settings copy and here in the same words rather than hidden:

> With no prompt of your own the decoder prompt is chosen by the language of the dictation, and that costs one extra
> detect-only language pass over the audio before each dictation — measured +1.34 s against a 3.5 s decode, ≈ 38 % —
> paid only while this switch is on and no prompt is set; and on pause-heavy English speech the switch changes two
> words against the switch off ("Basically now it creates a sentences" where the switch off says "Basically how it
> creates a sentence"), a change the captain accepted on 2026-09-25 with the measurement in front of him, because no
> prompt removes it and the Polish fix rides on the same silence.

That is the captain's decision of **2026-09-25** taken on the measurement below — option (a), "pause fix everywhere,
English takes a 2-word change" — and the shipped configuration is asserted against exactly it, Polish win present and
no wider English delta, in `WhisperPauseBoundaryPairingTests`. Off is byte-for-byte the behaviour every earlier build
had; a prompt set by hand always wins over the default, whatever the language; and a language nobody measured gets
**no** prompt, which is what this app sent before the table existed.

What it does, in the decoder's terms:

* `PauseBoundaryPolicy.restored` keeps `min(pause, 0.8 s)` of the recording's **own** silence at each gap, and
  zero-pads only up to upstream's 0.1 s minimum — so the silence the decoder hears is the silence the speaker
  left, never a synthetic block;
* the same pass returns the pauses it measured, with their span in the decoder's own centisecond clock, and a
  pause of **0.6 s or more** ends the sentence: the join gets a terminator where the decoder left the sentence
  open. A segment that already closed its sentence is untouched, so nothing is doubled; a segment that *starts*
  before the pause ends decoded straight through the pause, and no boundary is invented inside its text;
* the terminator is language-aware (`.` — `。` for Chinese, Japanese and Korean), timestamp mode is unchanged
  (one decoder segment per line), no word is ever altered, and no punctuation is added inside a sentence.

**What the measurement said, including the parts that argue against it.** Measured on his own two Polish
recordings and an English control, through this app's own decode path, with his settings and the decoder prompt
this app sent at the time — **none** (the pairing measurement reported further down is what changed that).

* The same arm decoded twice is identical on all three recordings, so a before/after difference is the switch and
  not sampling. The transcripts the app stored for those recordings are reproduced **byte for byte by the
  switch-off arm with the instruction-shaped prompt an earlier brief attributed to his preferences** as the
  decoder prompt — which is evidence that *that* string was reaching the decoder when he dictated them, not of
  anything the app ships: `initialPrompt` defaults to the empty string and his stored domain holds no value. (The
  decoder prompt a dictation *sends* is the language default described above, never a stored value; on
  `pl-2` the switch off with that string reads "Ben super whisper… Dałem drugi model"; with no prompt, "Będę super
  whisper… Dałem drugi model".)
* The pause being kept is what fixes the Polish: `pl-2` comes back "**Open Super Whisper**" and "**Dodałem** drugi
  model" where the switch off garbles the same two places ("Będę super whisper… Dałem drugi model" with no prompt,
  "Ben super whisper… Dałem drugi model" with the attributed string), and `pl-1`'s verb arrives as "spieprzył po
  całości" instead of "pieprzył po całości"; with no prompt the switch also turns `pl-1` from two comma-joined
  sentences back into three.
* **With no decoder prompt the English control regresses** — and not by two words, by inventing a fragment:
  "Basically, now it creates,. **based, no,** now it creates a sentences…" where the switch off is clean, **at
  every silence cap tried** (0.2 s, 0.4 s, 0.6 s, 0.8 s; 0.4 s and 0.6 s are worse still — "profound sense",
  lowercase drift). A deliberate decoder prompt is what removes that fragment; the switch does not ship without one.
* **A deliberate decoder prompt removes that regression, and the switch now ships with one.** Four prompts were
  measured on the same recordings with the same sampling — none, the instruction-shaped string the brief attributed
  to him, and two candidates written as ordinary Polish dictation with full punctuation and no instruction — and each
  is reported as a **counted word-level delta** against the no-prompt arm, because a prompt that fixes punctuation by
  moving words is not a win. With a prompt in the language of the audio the invented fragment is gone; the
  instruction-shaped string is not better on English than the shipped candidate (both `-2 +2`) and moves four words
  instead of two on `pl-2`, so it is deliberately not a default — if he wants its individual recoveries ("spój" →
  "swój", "forkę" → "fork", and it drops a spurious "I"), they belong in his own `initialPrompt`, which this fork
  never writes for him.
* **The prompt and the switch were then measured together, in both languages, and the answer is why there are two
  strings and not one.** Crossing every prompt with every language on his own three recordings
  (`WhisperPauseBoundaryPairingTests`; tables in `fleet/data/fm-20260925-14/report.md`) shows a prompt that suits one
  language is damage in the other: a Polish prompt on English audio brings the fragments back and splits the control
  into twelve pieces (`-how -sentence +creates +it +no +now +now +sentences`, seven of them two words or shorter, and
  with the second Polish candidate Polish words leak into the English text — "Aż to add feature… Nooo…"), an English
  prompt on Polish audio costs `pl-1` its boundary and hyphenates `pl-2`'s word ("fork-a"). So the default is keyed to
  the language the engine measures, and the Polish entry is the **comma-free** candidate: the comma-heavy ones prime
  the decoder into joining `pl-1`'s clauses with a comma and **trade away the sentence boundary the switch exists to
  gain** ("…inną drogą**,** bo tu chodzi…", two sentences — the switch-off count), while the comma-free one keeps it
  ("…inną drogą. Bo tu chodzi…", three) and keeps `pl-2`'s "Open Super Whisper" and "Dodałem". The English entry is
  the arm whose residue is the two words below.
* **No prompt fixes the English audio half, and that was the captain's call to make.** With the switch on, the English
  control is never word-identical to the switch off — not with any of the six prompts, not with none: the shortest
  difference is `-how -sentence +now +sentences`, and it is there in the arm that sends no prompt at all, identical
  across two different prompts and unmoved by the cap (`0.2…0.8 s`). It is what keeping the real pause does to the
  decode, so the choice was the switch with those two words or no switch. He took the switch on **2026-09-25**, and
  the criterion test asserts exactly that delta, so a future change that quietly widens it fails the suite.
* **What the pairing costs.** The language has to be known *before* the prompt is chosen, which this app's engine can
  only do with whisper.cpp's detect-only pass (`detect_language`: mel + encoder, no token). Measured on his own audio
  with the app's own context parameters, that pass is **1343/1314 ms** against a **3522/3391 ms** decode on `pl-1`,
  **1336/1351 ms** against **3560/3813 ms** on `pl-2` and **1346/1348 ms** against **3548/3509 ms** on the English
  control — about **38 %** of every dictation whose switch is on and whose prompt is empty, because the encoder always
  processes the fixed 30 s window. It was accurate on all three (the pre-pass's language equals the decode's own), and
  an English-only model pays nothing: it cannot be multilingual, so it is `en` by construction.
* **The threshold was 0.5 s and the measurement removed it.** On `pl-1` a pause the VAD measured at 0.52 s falls
  inside "…o to, że żeś | spieprzył po całości", and 0.5 s closed the sentence there — "że żeś. spieprzył" (the
  same wrong break appears at 0.4 s). On the app's own numbers every pause he talks across is 0.52 s or below and
  every boundary he punctuates is 0.74 s or above, so the threshold is **0.6 s**, and at 0.6 s that arm comes back
  unchanged.
* **The cap is measured too.** At 0.2 s the decoder loses `pl-1`'s sentence break (two comma-joined sentences
  where the switch off has a full stop and the stored text has three), 0.4 s and 0.6 s leave a stray ". ," at the
  join, and only 0.8 s keeps `pl-1` at three sentences while leaving the join clean — so the cap is 0.8 s.
* **A smaller cap does not save the English control**, which is worth knowing before anyone tries: the invented
  fragment is there at 0.2 s, 0.4 s, 0.6 s and 0.8 s alike. What perturbs it is keeping *any* real silence where
  upstream had a 0.1 s breath, not how long that silence is — the switch, or a prompt, is the answer to that, not
  another cap.

### 9. Settings, models and diagnostics made visible

Several of these are the difference between a feature existing and a feature being *findable*:

- **Settings is reachable from the status-bar menu**, so it works with the main window closed — previously the
  only entries were inside a window that could be closed, and features appeared not to exist.
- **The Settings sheet lays out correctly.** macOS lays a `TabView`'s strip out 0×0 inside a sheet, which made
  the tabs unclickable; the strip is a segmented picker now, and a snapshot test asserts the sheet is not clipped.
- **Model management.** Every whisper model file on disk — downloaded or placed by hand — is listed with the one
  in use, can be verified against the publisher's published SHA-256 (the bundled model included) or removed with
  the space it frees reported, and a missing selection is reported instead of silently switching models.
- **Debug Mode** is wired through to whisper.cpp's verbose decode trace, and **Show the welcome screen again**
  re-runs the first-run flow without disturbing the existing choices.
- **The indicator is honest.** With no microphone it says so, instead of showing "Processing…" forever, and a
  dictation whose transcript was lost says why.

### 10. Packaging and uninstall

Upstream ships a package built from its own release process and has no uninstaller. This fork adds
`packaging/{build-pkg.sh,distribution.xml,scripts/preinstall,uninstall.sh}` plus `UninstallService.swift`: one
package installs the app and its uninstall command (no model weights — the app downloads those itself, from the
URLs and checksums it carries, so the package stays ~88 MB). One operation — **Settings → Advanced → Uninstall
OpenSuperWhisper…**, the same item in the menu-bar menu, or `/Applications/Uninstall OpenSuperWhisper.command` if
the app is already gone — removes the app, that command, the models the app downloaded, the caches and the installer
receipt, and **keeps the recordings, the transcriptions and the settings**; only `--remove-user-data` takes those,
and `--help` says so in as many words. Running it twice is harmless, other applications' data is never touched, and
`Scripts/verify-packaging.sh` runs the whole install → uninstall → install-again cycle against scratch roots,
asserting what survives and what does not, rather than trusting the path list.

### 11. Developer tooling

Local Debug builds are signed with a stable self-signed identity (`Scripts/dev-signing-identity.sh`,
`dev-sign.sh`) so the Accessibility grant survives rebuilds, and `Scripts/dev-run.sh` is the single entry point
that builds with the debug dylib disabled, signs, and can run the unit suite *and re-sign afterwards* — a bare
`xcodebuild test` leaves an ad-hoc signed bundle and is exactly the failure the script exists to prevent.
`Scripts/build-native.sh` builds the two vendored engines in the one order that works (llama.cpp installs the
single ggml package that whisper.cpp then links against). Crew worktrees build under a different bundle id, and
each test process gets its own preference store, so parallel development cannot poison the app someone is using.
The suite on this tree is **473 tests** — the captain's-recording measurement cases among them, which is why it is
larger than CI's: they skip wherever his recordings or a multilingual model are absent. Its last full run here stood
at **418 passing, 1 failing, 54 skipped**, the failure being the Settings snapshot capture harness described in
`fleet/data/fm-20260925-14/report.md` (its detector read the page background from a row that is inside a card in a
capture scrolled to the bottom); that harness is repaired and was verified green on its own afterwards
(`SettingsLayoutSnapshotTests`, 7/7). The clean full suite on the merged tip is the fleet's record, not this
paragraph's. The rest of the skips are environmental: 50 gated on this machine's input sources or on Accessibility
automation, 2 behind `OSW_TEST_TURBO_MODEL` and 1 behind a microphone opt-in. That 50 is why the daily delivery path
is the least covered part of the suite.

### 12. A dictation that produced no text

**No text means nothing to see.** An outcome that yields no text is silent: nothing appears anywhere the user
looks — no alert, no history row, no copy left behind, nothing inserted. Two cases produce it, and in both the
audio goes with the row that was never written: the voice-activity detector found no speech segment in the
recording at all, or the capture itself never wrote a frame. The decision is taken once, in
`Utils/DictationFailurePolicy.swift` (`DictationFailurePolicy.outcome(for:)`), and every surface that can end a
dictation settles its failure through it — the indicator, the main window's record button, the transcription
queue, and the recorder's own capture failures — so one path cannot refuse in silence while another reports. That
rule is only for absence: a *real* failure, an engine or a converter that failed over audio which really was
recorded, is untouched and keeps what the app has always done — alert, failed row, audio kept.

**The exception, and why it leaves a row.** A refusal whose evidence is a *measured* no-speech probability at or
above the user's own `noSpeechThreshold` keeps the recording instead. That threshold is whisper's own
`no_speech_thold`, **0.6** by default — whisper.cpp's default, surfaced as **No Speech Threshold** in
**Settings → Advanced → Model Parameters**, adjustable there, and the same line the decoder itself is handed, so
nothing about it was invented for this fork. A probability is a guess about audio that really was recorded, and a
guess must not destroy what he said; and because the recording is kept the user has to be able to find it, since
a kept recording nobody can locate is a lost one. The audio is moved into the recordings directory and a row
records it (`RecordingStore.saveFailedDictation`), so it appears in **History as a failed row with no
transcript**, playable like any other recording, and ages with everything else under the same retention sweep.
Nothing is pasted and no alert fires: this row is a record, not a delivery.

**A file the user queued is not ours to touch.** A file queued from disk (drag & drop) is treated differently on
purpose. Refused for having no speech — the detector's verdict or the measured probability alike — its row stays
and names the file it stands for (`sourceFileURL`, which History shows), so he can tell which file it was, while
**the file itself is never moved, copied or deleted** (`TranscriptionQueue.isOurOwnRecording`); silence there
would leave him unable to tell whether the transcription had worked. Transcribed successfully it behaves as
before: the audio is copied into the recordings directory so the row can play it, and the file he queued stays
exactly where it is.

**An empty failed row says so, and nothing else.** The transcript column carries what the user dictated, never a
failure's own description, so a failed row whose transcript is empty reads **"No transcript"** in plain secondary
text: the app did not break, and the row must not read as if it had. Rows written before the column stopped
carrying failure text can still hold one, and those keep the red "Transcription failed" marker and the stored text
under it.

### What is unchanged

Inherited from upstream, unmodified in behaviour: the whisper.cpp and Parakeet (FluidAudio) transcription
engines and their model downloads, key-combination and single-modifier triggers, the mouse-button trigger,
hold-to-record, drag & drop with the transcription queue, microphone selection (including iPhone/Continuity),
language detection (now always automatic — see §2), Asian-language autocorrect, the Hebrew (ivrit.ai) model
entry, onboarding, and the MIT licence. Upstream's own README sections — Installation, Requirements, Support, Building locally, Contributing,
Whisper Models — are kept as they are, apart from the notes this fork needed.

### Known limits and what is not built yet

- **The larger model is a preference, not a guarantee.** `Qwen3-8B-Q4_K_M` is what a tone rewrite and Polish
  clean-up *prefer*, and it is not required: with only the shipped 1.5B installed, that work runs on it, and the
  card says so. Two measurements justify the preference: the tone run in `fm-20260924-10` (the failures above
  are all absent on the 8B with the same prompt) and the earlier 8B/1.5B comparison taken on the translation
  direction this fork removed (`fm-20260923-24`: 8B 11/15 clean and nothing invented, 1.5B 4/15 with 2
  invented). Both are carried as a preference stated in the Settings card.
- **The guard catches the class, not the drift.** An assistant frame, a label line, the prompt's own delimiter,
  a stub and a language flip are rejected deterministically; subtle content drift (an article dropped, a noun
  invented) is text the guard cannot judge, and it is the prompt's and the 8B's job. Nothing here grades
  rewrite quality at scale.
- **The better 30B-A3B is not shipped.** It measured well and is fast per call, but it needs ~18 GB of RAM and
  ~44 s to load, which the 10-minute idle unload cannot hide on a 32 GB machine — and with the external-endpoint
  override gone there is no supported way to run it against the app.
- **In-process transform determinism is an open question.** The sampling chain is fully seed-pinned already
  (`Llama.swift:270-278`, `dist(seed = 0)`, a fresh chain per request), so identical inputs *should* give
  identical outputs; observed differences on this machine point at backend reduction nondeterminism rather than
  seeding. Unresolved, and not a claim this fork makes.
- **The delivery path is the least covered by tests** (see the skip breakdown above), which is the next test work
  queued.
- This fork has **no binary releases**: it is built from source, and its permission grants are tied to a locally created
  signing identity. A tagged release carries these notes and no installer — an unsigned package would be refused by
  Gatekeeper on any other Mac and could never carry a stable Accessibility grant there. The code itself is at `main` in this fork's own repository; upstream has received nothing.

## Installation

Download `OpenSuperWhisper-<version>.pkg` from the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Starmel/OpenSuperWhisper/releases) and run it, or:

```shell
brew update # Optional
brew install opensuperwhisper
```

Everything the app needs is inside the package: the speech engine (whisper.cpp
plus llama.cpp for tone and clean-up) is linked into the app, its Metal
shaders are embedded in it, and neither needs Homebrew, a background server or a
listening port. Speech models (and, if you use the tone or clean-up switches, the
rewrite models: ~1 GB for the model every language can run on, plus an optional
~5 GB 8B that tone rewrites prefer in both languages and Polish clean-up prefers)
are downloaded by the app into its own folder on
first use.

On first launch macOS asks for the two permissions the app needs:

| Permission | Why | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| **Microphone** | recording | Privacy & Security → Microphone |
| **Accessibility** | typing the transcript into the focused app | Privacy & Security → Accessibility |

Both grant the *app binary*. If you rebuild it locally with a different
signature, macOS treats it as a different app and the grant must be given again.

The same two grants are visible inside the app — **Settings → Shortcuts →
Permissions** — with their current state and a button that opens the pane which
restores a missing one. With the Whisper engine, **Settings → Model** lists every
model file that is on disk, downloaded or put there by hand, marks the one in use,
and each row can be verified against the sha256 its publisher reports or removed
outright, reporting the space that frees; the Parakeet rows report whether every
file the engine needs is present, which is all FluidAudio publishes. **Settings →
Advanced** carries the **Debug Mode** switch
that makes whisper.cpp print its verbose decode trace, and **Show the welcome
screen again**, which re-runs the first-run flow (shortcut and speech model)
without changing either until you choose.

## Uninstalling

One operation removes the app, your dictation history, the downloaded models and
the installer receipt:

- **Settings → Advanced → Uninstall OpenSuperWhisper…**, or the same item in the menu-bar menu; or
- `/Applications/Uninstall OpenSuperWhisper.command`, if the app is already gone.

It leaves `~/models`, `/opt/homebrew` and every other application's data alone,
and running it twice is harmless.

## Requirements

- macOS (Apple Silicon/ARM64)

## Support

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please:
1. Check the existing issues in the repository
2. Create a new issue with detailed information about your problem
3. Include system information and logs when reporting bugs

## Building locally

To build locally, you'll need:

    git clone git@github.com:Starmel/OpenSuperWhisper.git
    cd OpenSuperWhisper
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    brew install cmake rust ruby
    gem install xcpretty
    ./run.sh build

The vendored engines are built by `Scripts/build-native.sh`: llama.cpp is
configured first and installs its ggml package, then whisper.cpp is configured
against that same ggml (`WHISPER_USE_SYSTEM_GGML=ON`). There is exactly one ggml
in the app image — linking a second copy fails with duplicate symbols.

In case of problems, consult `.github/workflows/build.yml` which is our CI workflow
where the app gets built automatically on GitHub's CI.

### Keeping permission grants across rebuilds

A Debug build from `run.sh` carries no identity — it is at best linker-signed with an
ad-hoc signature, and Xcode writes the target's code into `OpenSuperWhisper.debug.dylib`
behind a stub binary (`ENABLE_DEBUG_DYLIB` defaults to `YES` in Debug). An ad-hoc
signature's designated requirement is a hash of the exact binary
(`# designated => cdhash H"…"`), and macOS stores Accessibility, Microphone and
Automation grants against that requirement. Every rebuild therefore produces a binary
that no longer matches the grant: System Settings still shows Accessibility as granted
while the app is refused. tccd logs exactly that, seconds after the grant was recorded:

```
tccd: Update Access Record: kTCCServiceAccessibility for ru.starmel.OpenSuperWhisper to Allowed (System Set)
tccd: -[TCCDAccessIdentity matchesCodeRequirement:]: SecStaticCodeCheckValidity() static code
      (0x7b9f1bc300) from ru.starmel.OpenSuperWhisper : identifier
      "ru.starmel.OpenSuperWhisper" and certificate leaf = H"32266bcc…"; status: -67050
```

`-67050` is `errSecCSReqFailed`: the copy that is running does not satisfy the
requirement the grant was stored with. The same trap has a second half — because the
real code lives in the debug dylib, the binary TCC attributes is the ~40 KB stub, not
the app. `Scripts/dev-run.sh` (and therefore `./run.sh`) removes a product left in that
split layout before building it and refuses to launch one that survives.

The recorded grant can be tested against any build without launching it, with the same
check tccd performs:

```shell
codesign --verify -R '=identifier "ru.starmel.OpenSuperWhisper" and certificate leaf = H"32266bcc…"' <app>
```

Sign local builds with a real (self-signed) identity instead. It is created without
sudo, without an Apple account, and lives in its own keychain. `./run.sh` is now a thin
alias for `Scripts/dev-run.sh`, so the command above already takes this path:

```shell
Scripts/dev-signing-identity.sh   # once per machine: creates "OpenSuperWhisper Local Dev"
Scripts/dev-run.sh                # build (debug dylib off), sign, run
Scripts/dev-run.sh build          # build and sign only
Scripts/dev-run.sh test           # build, run the unit suite, then sign again
```

Run the suite through `Scripts/dev-run.sh test` rather than a bare `xcodebuild test`.
The test action rebuilds the app target with signing off, so it leaves the copy on
disk linker-signed ("`# designated => cdhash H"…"`"), and the next launch of that copy
has the same "grant does not stick" problem described above. The script signs the
bundle again after the suite — whether it passed or not — and asserts the identity
requirement is what is actually on disk. xcodebuild flags are forwarded, so a single
class still goes through that path:

```shell
Scripts/dev-run.sh test -only-testing:OpenSuperWhisperTests/TransformBackendTests
```

It also offers the language-report cases a multilingual model when this machine happens
to have one (`OSW_TEST_MULTILINGUAL_MODEL`); with none, they skip, exactly as in CI.
Tests read and write a scratch preference store of their own rather than the app's
domain, so a suite cannot change — or be changed by — the app someone is running or
another suite running in parallel.

Any other copy can be signed the same way, by pointing the signing script at it:

```shell
Scripts/dev-sign.sh build/Build/Products/Debug/OpenSuperWhisper.app
```

Every signed bundle then reports the same requirement, whatever changed in the code:

```
designated => identifier "ru.starmel.OpenSuperWhisper" and certificate leaf = H"…"
```

Because that requirement is derived from the signing identity, not from the binary, the
grant is made once per identity and survives rebuilds. If a valid `Developer ID
Application` identity exists in your keychains, both scripts prefer it and never create
the self-signed one. Remove the self-signed identity in one line:

```shell
Scripts/dev-signing-identity.sh --remove
```

Granting is the one step no script can do for you: the app has to be running and asking
for it, and you have to turn the switch on in System Settings → Privacy & Security →
Accessibility. The app never blocks on this — it shows an inline "Keystrokes are off —
grant Accessibility" notice with a button that opens that pane, and the notice clears
itself as soon as the switch is on. When you move from an ad-hoc-signed build to an
identity-signed one, the recorded grant matches the old requirement, so drop it once and
grant again:

```shell
tccutil reset Accessibility ru.starmel.OpenSuperWhisper
Scripts/dev-run.sh
```

From then on ordinary rebuilds keep the grant; `Scripts/dev-run.sh --reset-tcc` does that
reset for you if you ever need it again.

## Tone and clean-up (in the language you spoke)

Two independent switches in **Settings → Transcription**, both off by default: **Apply tone** (with a
Formal / Casual / Neutral picker) and **Clean up dictation**. When either is on, the app runs an
instruction-tuned model **inside itself** — llama.cpp is linked into the app exactly like whisper.cpp, no
server, no port, no cloud service, and there is no endpoint override any more. Turn a switch on and press
**Download model** next to a model in Settings → Transcription: the app fetches those weights into its own
Application Support folder, verifies the pinned checksum, and keeps them there.

**The language of the transcript is never changed.** Polish comes back Polish, English comes back English.
The tone switch asks for a different register of the *same* text; the clean-up switch removes filler, repairs
punctuation, articles and word order, and drops stutters. Neither one is a translation, and no setting in the
app can make them one. **The instruction is written in the language of the dictation too**, so a Polish
dictation is asked for in Polish and an English one in English — on the captain's own Polish recordings that
held his words still far more often than asking in English did (25 of 28 tone answers byte-identical against
15, one invented word against two, one dropped word against four), and the Polish prompt additionally names
the two `TRANSCRIPT` markers and forbids repeating them, because without that the model echoed the closing
marker back as a word of its own answer on short dictations.

**Which model each job uses.** The model is a preference, not a requirement:

| Job | Language | Model (Apache-2.0) | Download | RAM while loaded |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tone (with or without clean-up) | English | `Qwen3-8B-Q4_K_M` when installed | ~5.0 GB | ~5.3 GB |
| Tone (with or without clean-up) | Polish | `Qwen3-8B-Q4_K_M` when installed | ~5.0 GB | ~5.3 GB |
| Tone — when the 8B is not installed | either | `Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-Q4_K_M` | ~986 MB | ~1.1 GB |
| Clean-up alone | English | `Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-Q4_K_M` | ~986 MB | ~1.1 GB |
| Clean-up alone | Polish | `Qwen3-8B-Q4_K_M` when installed | ~5.0 GB | ~5.3 GB |

Nothing has to be downloaded for either job to work: with only the shipped 1.5B installed, tone and Polish
clean-up run on it, and the Settings card says exactly that ("The 8B is not installed, so the shipped model
does the work — nothing is refused…"). A tone rewrite is the job that has to move the register while holding
every fact still, and that is what the shipped model was measured getting wrong, so the 8B is preferred for it
in both languages; clean-up alone is grammar repair and does not need the larger model. Only one model is ever
resident: a change of job or language unloads one before loading the other, so the wired memory is the model in
use, not the sum. Either is released after ten minutes without a transform; because the 8B's cold load is
seconds rather than milliseconds, the app warms up the model the current switches imply when recording starts —
the 8B while tone is on and it is installed, and the shipped model otherwise — so the load happens while you are
still speaking. (Tone runs on one model in both languages, which is why the warm-up follows the switches rather
than a language.)

**And if the rewrite is not a rewrite.** The prompt forbids answering, greeting, acknowledging or labelling the
dictation, and the user turn is framed and delimited (`<<<TRANSCRIPT … TRANSCRIPT>>>`) so dictated instructions
are rewritten rather than obeyed. Because the prompt alone did not survive the small model, a deterministic
guard then reads the answer: an assistant frame, a `Register:`/`Output:` label, an announcement of the
"rewritten text" (in either language), the prompt's own `TRANSCRIPT`/`TRANSKRYPCJA` delimiter returned as the
answer, a stub of a dictation that carried a sentence, or an answer with no word of the language that went in —
any of those and your own transcript is pasted instead, with a notice saying so and the same reason recorded
under the last dictation. A frame or a label counts only when the model *added* it:
if you dictated "Here is the summary…" or "I've already…", the rewrite that keeps your opening is kept too. The
delimiter counts only as an all-caps marker standing on a line of its own, or as a word attached to `<<<`/`>>>`:
`I need the transcript by Friday.` is your sentence and comes back as one. The guard makes no model call, so it
cannot hallucinate; what it cannot see is subtle content drift — the prompt's and the 8B's job — and, in the
answer, a marker a model invents later in a spelling neither prompt uses, unless it arrives inside the brackets.

| Tone | Clean up | Spoken language | Pasted text |
|---|---|---|---|
| off | off | any | the raw transcript — nothing is detected, nothing is called |
| on | off | Polish | rewritten Polish, formal/casual/neutral, same language |
| on | off | English | rewritten English, same language |
| off | on | any placed language | the transcript repaired in the language it was spoken in |
| on | on | either | one call carrying both instructions |
| any | any | unplaceable text | the raw transcript — no prompt can name the language to keep |

Dictation history always keeps the raw transcript, and recordings transcribed from the list (queued or re-run
files) are never rewritten. The language of each utterance is detected automatically, which needs a
multilingual whisper model (e.g. Turbo V3): an English-only model such as `ggml-tiny.en.bin` cannot detect
anything, so when the transcript it produces does not read as English the app refuses that dictation, names
the model, and offers the multilingual model to switch to.

The packaging contract — the uninstaller's path list, its idempotence and a built package's payload —
is checked with:

```shell
Scripts/verify-packaging.sh --app build/Build/Products/Release/OpenSuperWhisper.app
```

## Whisper Models

You can download Whisper model files (`.bin`) from the [Whisper.cpp Hugging Face repository](https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/main). Place the downloaded `.bin` files in the app's models directory. On first launch, the app will attempt to copy a default model automatically, but you can add more models manually.

### Hebrew (ivrit.ai)

For Hebrew transcription, download the **"Turbo V3 Hebrew"** model from Settings → Model. It is [ivrit.ai](https://www.ivrit.ai/)'s Hebrew fine-tune of `whisper-large-v3-turbo` ([whisper-large-v3-turbo-ggml](https://huggingface.co/ivrit-ai/whisper-large-v3-turbo-ggml)) — the same base model as the other "Turbo V3" entries, but tuned for Hebrew. Selecting it automatically sets the input language to Hebrew, which these models require to be set explicitly.
