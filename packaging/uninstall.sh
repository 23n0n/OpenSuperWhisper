# Uninstall OpenSuperWhisper.
#
# Two entry points, one implementation:
#
#   * Settings -> Advanced -> Uninstall OpenSuperWhisper..., or the same item in
#     the menu-bar menu. The app copies this script to a temporary file, starts
#     it with `--wait-pid <its own pid>` and quits. The script waits for that
#     process to exit before it removes anything.
#   * `/Applications/Uninstall OpenSuperWhisper.command`, shipped by the
#     installer, for when the app is already gone from /Applications.
#
# One path used to stand for six different kinds of thing. `rm -rf` on the
# Application Support directory took the recordings, the transcriptions database
# and the settings out together with the models, so an uninstall that was meant
# to remove an app destroyed the captain's dictation history as well --
# unrecoverably, because nothing went to the Trash. The list is path-granular
# now, and each path is one kind of thing:
#
#   removed by default
#       the app; the uninstall command; any model copies in
#       /Library/Application Support/<bundle id>/Models (an earlier package put
#       weights there; this one has the app download them instead, but the
#       directory is the app's own and a stale GB must not be left behind); the
#       models the app downloaded into its own directory; caches, HTTP storage,
#       saved state and application scripts; OS leftovers named after the app;
#       and the installer receipt.
#   kept by default
#       the recordings, the transcriptions database and the settings -- the part
#       of the app's directory that is the user's rather than the installer's.
#   --remove-user-data
#       removes the kept list too. Nothing else removes it.
#
# Idempotent by construction: every step tolerates absence, so running it twice
# -- or after deleting the app by hand -- is harmless.
#
# Nothing outside the list below is touched. In particular this never removes
# ~/models (the developer's own copy of the model files), /opt/homebrew (where a
# user-installed llama.cpp lives), or any other application's data.
#
# Testing: OSW_INSTALL_ROOT prefixes every absolute path (default "/"), so the
# whole path list can be exercised against a scratch tree. Everything that needs
# the real machine -- quitting the app, cfprefsd, the installer receipt, TCC --
# runs only when the root is "/", so a probe can never disturb the live system.

Uninstall OpenSuperWhisper.

Usage: uninstall.sh [options]

Removed without any option:
  the app, the uninstall command, any model copies in
  /Library/Application Support/ru.starmel.OpenSuperWhisper/Models (an earlier
  package installed some there; this one has the app download models instead),
  the models the app downloaded for itself, its caches and window state, and the
  installer receipt.

Kept without any option:
  your recordings, the transcriptions database and your settings. Uninstalling
  the app is not supposed to throw away your dictation history.

  --remove-user-data     also remove the recordings, the transcriptions
                         database and the settings -- everything the app wrote
                         under your home directory. Without this flag they are
                         kept, and a later install finds them again.
  --wait-pid <pid>       wait for that process to exit before removing anything
                         (used by the in-app uninstall action)
  --reset-permissions    also reset the microphone/accessibility grants
  --self-delete          remove this script when done (the in-app action runs a
                         temporary copy of it)
  --quiet                say nothing
  -h, --help             this text

Environment:
  OSW_INSTALL_ROOT       prefix every path with this directory (default "/").
                         For testing the path list against a scratch tree.
