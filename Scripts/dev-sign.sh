# Signs a locally built OpenSuperWhisper.app so its permissions survive rebuilds.
#
# A Debug build from run.sh is linker-signed at best (run.sh builds with
# CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO), and an ad-hoc signature yields the designated
# requirement `cdhash H"..."`, which changes on every build. macOS stores
# Accessibility/Microphone/Automation grants in TCC against that requirement, so
# each rebuild invalidates the grant: System Settings keeps showing the switch as
# on while the app is still refused. Signing with a certificate instead makes the
# requirement
#
#   identifier "ru.starmel.OpenSuperWhisper" and certificate leaf = H"..."
#
# which is identical for every rebuild signed with the same identity.
#
# Note that Xcode also emits the target code into OpenSuperWhisper.debug.dylib
# behind a stub executable when ENABLE_DEBUG_DYLIB is YES (the Debug default),
# which is one more reason the bundle does not match what people test. This
# script signs whatever layout it is given; Scripts/dev-run.sh builds with the
# debug dylib disabled.
#
# Usage:
#   Scripts/dev-sign.sh <path-to-app>
#   Scripts/dev-sign.sh --identity "Developer ID Application: X (TEAM)" <path-to-app>
#   Scripts/dev-sign.sh --keychain ~/Library/Keychains/opensuperwhisper-dev.keychain-db <path-to-app>
#
# The identity is picked in this order: --identity/$DEV_SIGN_IDENTITY, an
# existing valid Developer ID Application identity, then the self-signed
# "OpenSuperWhisper Local Dev" identity, which is created on demand by
# Scripts/dev-signing-identity.sh.
#
# Environment overrides:
#   DEV_SIGN_IDENTITY     identity name or SHA-1 to sign with
#   DEV_SIGN_KEYCHAIN     keychain holding that identity
#   DEV_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS entitlements plist (default: OpenSuperWhisper/OpenSuperWhisper.entitlements)
