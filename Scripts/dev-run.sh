#!/bin/bash

# Builds and launches a Debug OpenSuperWhisper that keeps its permission grants
# across rebuilds.
#
# This is run.sh with the three things that broke the permission screen changed:
#
#   1. ENABLE_DEBUG_DYLIB=NO - Xcode's Debug default puts the target's code into
#      OpenSuperWhisper.debug.dylib behind a stub executable. That is not the
#      binary people are testing, and the stub is what makes the bundle look
#      "signed but resource-less" to codesign --verify --deep --strict.
#   2. The bundle is signed with a real (self-signed) identity afterwards, via
#      Scripts/dev-sign.sh, instead of being left unsigned/linker-signed. That
#      gives it the identity-based designated requirement TCC grants survive.
#   3. A build from a linked git worktree gets bundle id
#      ru.starmel.OpenSuperWhisper.dev through OSW_BUNDLE_ID_SUFFIX, so a crew
#      build can never take over the bundle id whose grant is being tested.
#      In the checkout whose app is tested the suffix is empty, as shipped.
#
# Like run.sh, the two vendored engines are built through Scripts/build-native.sh:
# llama.cpp owns the single ggml and whisper.cpp only configures against the
# package that script installs, so that order is not reproduced here.
#
# Usage:
#   Scripts/dev-run.sh              - build, sign, then run the app in the foreground
#   Scripts/dev-run.sh build        - build and sign only
#   Scripts/dev-run.sh test         - build, run the unit suite, then re-sign
#   Scripts/dev-run.sh --reset-tcc  - also drop the current Accessibility grant
#                                     before launching (needed once when moving
#                                     off an ad-hoc-signed build; see Readme)
#
# Why `test` is a mode of this script and not a bare xcodebuild: `xcodebuild test`
# rebuilds the app target with CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO, which leaves the bundle on
# disk linker-signed, i.e. `# designated => cdhash H"..."`. Launching that copy
# reintroduces the exact failure this script exists to prevent - tccd refuses the
# identity requirement the Accessibility grant is stored with (`status: -67050`) -
# so the suite runs here and the bundle is signed and asserted afterwards, whether
# the tests passed or not.
#
# Environment overrides:
#   DEVELOPER_DIR   Xcode to build with (default: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer)
#   DEV_SIGN_IDENTITY / DEV_SIGN_KEYCHAIN / DEV_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS  - see Scripts/dev-sign.sh
