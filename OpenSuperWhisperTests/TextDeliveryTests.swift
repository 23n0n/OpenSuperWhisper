/// The delivery mechanism: which one carries the transcript, and what that costs.
///
/// The captain dictates into a native macOS terminal, where the text arrives
/// whole, and into his Parallels guest, where it did not. `TextDelivery` answers
/// the two with two mechanisms. A design judgment, not an observation, decides
/// that split — what a guest received cannot be observed from this side at all —
/// so these cases pin the choice and everything it does on this side of the
/// boundary: the mechanism selected for a given application and preference, the
/// ⌘V pair that goes out, the state of the pasteboard while the paste is made,
/// and the previous contents coming back afterwards. Whether the guest then pastes
/// the transcript is not claimed here and cannot be tested in this suite.
///
/// Every case here uses a pasteboard of its own, named with a fresh UUID. The
/// general pasteboard is one system-wide object shared with every other process
/// on the machine, so a case that asserted a restore through it would race
/// whatever else is running — `StorageAndLanguageSettingsTests` already pins the
/// restore-on-a-changeCount contract, and these cases pin the delivery path that
/// uses it.
