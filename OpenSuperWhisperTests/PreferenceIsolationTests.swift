/// *where* `AppPreferences` reads and writes, so it is asserted here instead of
/// being re-checked in every test that touches a switch: with the app's own
/// domain behind it, two suites that inject different `GateSettings` would
/// disagree about `toneEnabled` depending on which process wrote last, and a
/// test that flips a switch would be flipping it for every other class running
/// in parallel. For the
/// model it is a property of how a test gets one: the tests hand their fixture to
/// `WhisperEngine(modelPath:)`, because `selectedWhisperModelPath` describes the
/// machine, not the test.
