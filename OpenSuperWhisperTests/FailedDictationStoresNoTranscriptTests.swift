/// The regression: a failed dictation used to be stored with the failure's own
/// text as the row's transcript — a bare `TranscriptionError` bridges to
/// "The operation couldn’t be completed. (OpenSuperWhisper.TranscriptionError error 1.)",
/// which then read in history as if the user had dictated it. A failed row must
/// carry no transcript while the audio it was asked to keep stays on disk.
///
/// Where the files live is deliberate, not sloppiness — do not "tidy" it into a
/// seam: `saveFailedDictation` relocates failed audio into
/// `Recording.recordingsDirectory`, the app's own directory (derived from the
/// bundle id, not injectable), and keeps it there for a retry. That relocation
/// is the feature under test, and `FailedAudioPreservationTests` already takes
/// the same route. So: the database is a fresh in-memory `DatabaseQueue`, the
/// only file this test writes is a WAV inside its own temporary directory, and
/// the single copy production relocates is removed by `defer` at the exact URL
/// the call returned — never a glob, never the directory, so a failure here can
/// not delete anything else of the user's.
