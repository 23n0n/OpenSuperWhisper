/// Interference safety: a transcript must never be typed into the wrong

///
/// Both cases are produced here the way the machine produces them. The delivery
/// posts into whichever receiver is frontmost when the event is handed over, and
/// a competing keystroke reaches the receiver outside the delivery's own sink —
/// the one step a headless test must not take is posting the events through the
/// HID event tap for the window server to route.
///
/// Each case runs twice: once with a watch, which must stop the delivery at the
/// interference, and once without one, which is the behaviour before this
/// existed. The second run is not decoration: it is the same interference in the
/// same place, and it shows the assertion failing on the old behaviour — that is
/// what each test catches.
