Tone and the e-mail mode run on the instruction model, in Polish and English alike — Polish tone is new; the deterministic scrub is still what Polish clean-up is — while English clean-up alone runs on S1-mini. With both switches off and no e-mail trigger, nothing is sent to a model at all. Before any model runs, a deterministic function replaces profanity and crude slang with neutral wording that carries the same meaning, so that part is a guarantee rather than the model's judgement; if the model then refuses the job or invents a bracketed placeholder, the answer is thrown away and the dictation is delivered with the profanity already neutralised, with a notice that the rewrite did not happen. Every dictation reports the detected language and shows the raw transcript beside the cleaned and rewritten text; history always keeps the raw transcript, and recordings transcribed from the list are never rewritten. The language of each utterance is detected automatically, which needs a multilingual whisper model.")
