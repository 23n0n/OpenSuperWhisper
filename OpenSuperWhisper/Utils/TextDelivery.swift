/// Hands a finished transcript to the focused application.
///
/// # Why there are two mechanisms
///
/// There are two kinds of target, and no single mechanism is correct for both.
///
/// A **native macOS target** (TextEdit, Terminal, a browser) receives key events
/// from the window server and inserts the Unicode string the event carries. One
/// keyDown per chunk is exactly one insertion, which is what
/// `KeyboardSimulator.typeText` posts and what this fork has always done. It is
/// independent of the active keyboard layout, it never touches the clipboard,
/// and the captain's own dictation into a native terminal proves it: that text
/// arrives whole.
///
/// A **HID-forwarded target** — a virtual machine, a remote desktop, a VNC
/// viewer — is not reached by the window server's text at all: the host
/// application forwards what it receives on to a machine with its own input
/// stack, and the guest types what *it* makes of it. The text field on a
/// `CGEvent` is an Apple extension that nothing obliges a guest to look at, and
/// the key code the keystroke path carries its text on is 0 — `a` on any layout.
///
/// What a given host does with the events it captures has never been observed
/// from this side: there is no trace of the failing target's event stream, and
/// what a guest received cannot be read back from the host at all. This design
/// therefore does not rest on which of those two things the guest does. It rests
/// on the one mechanism whose transport *is* the text — see below.
///
/// # What the alternatives cost, and why this is the ladder
///
/// - **Real per-character key codes.** Rejected, and it cannot be made to work
///   in general. A key code names a *physical* key; the character it produces is
///   the guest's business. The machine this was fixed on has `PolishPro` active,
///   where all nine of `ą ć ę ł ń ó ś ź ż` sit behind Option (`0`→ą, `8`→ć,
///   `14`→ę, `37`→ł, and so on) — so `ClipboardUtil.findKeycodeForCharacter`,
///   which walks the layout's base layer, finds no key code for any of them, and
///   an implementation would have to send Option combinations instead. The guest
///   re-translates those under *its* layout: on a US guest layout, Option-plus-key
///   is `å`, `©`, `ß`… The code would be right only for the one pair of layouts
///   it was written against and wrong — silently, character by character — for
///   every other pair. The one thing per-character key codes can be relied on to
///   do is produce *some* text, which is how a wrong answer is delivered as if it
///   were a right one.
/// - **Accessibility insertion** (`kAXSelectedTextAttribute` on the focused
///   element). Not available for this: the guest holds the text, and the host
///   side of a virtual machine window exposes no text element, no selected
///   range, and no insertion point — `FocusUtils` reads AX only to place the
///   indicator, and the writes it would need do not exist in this tree. It could
///   not reach the target that is broken, so it is not a fallback.
/// - **The clipboard paste.** It is the mechanism that does not depend on the
///   unknown, and it is the reason this file exists. A virtual machine shares the
///   clipboard with the guest by default — clipboard sharing is on in both of the
///   guest machines on the Mac this was fixed on (`ClipboardSync/Enabled = 1` in
///   the `.pvm` configs) — the text travels as *text* (not as key codes), and ⌘V
///   is the one command every guest understands. It costs the fork its stated
///   doctrine — "the clipboard is never used" is no longer unconditionally true,
///   and the `Readme` and the Settings copy say so — plus a write-and-restore of
///   the user's clipboard. It also has a failure mode keystrokes do not: if the
///   guest's clipboard sharing is off, the paste does nothing and this app
///   cannot tell, because the only thing it can observe is its own pasteboard,
///   not what the guest did with it. `ClipboardUtil` writes the previous
///   contents back after `ClipboardUtil.clipboardRestoreDelay`, and only if the
///   clipboard is still the transcript it wrote.
///
///   An independent judgment (Jev, on this same evidence) put the clipboard
///   paste at 0.96 for a redirected target against 0.03 for a heuristic ladder,
///   0.01 for the fixed Unicode events and 0.00 for per-character key codes. The
///   ladder below still exists because its redirected-target branch *is* that
///   paste: what the target-aware rule decides is when the clipboard gets
///   written, and the alternative — pasting into every target, native ones
///   included, whose keystrokes are already known to arrive — would spend the
///   user's clipboard on every dictation to fix a case that only concerns some
///   of them. A user who wants the paste everywhere can say so:
///   `DeliveryPreference.clipboardPaste`.
///
///   **The restore is not a solution, and the code below says so rather than
///   implying otherwise.** Save-and-restore was judged sufficient at 0.22. What
///   has been measured on this side, and what it leaves open:
///
///   * *A target that services the paste late gets the wrong text.* The restore
///     runs on a timer (`ClipboardUtil.clipboardRestoreDelay`, 1.5 s). A target
///     that services the synthesized ⌘V after that — browsers, Electron apps and
///     remote sessions are exactly the slow consumers the delay exists for —
///     pastes whatever the clipboard holds *then*: the user's previous clipboard
///     contents, put into their document in place of the dictation. The measured
///     case in `TextDeliveryTests` demonstrates it rather than asserting it away.
///     There is no fix in this design: the app cannot know when the target
///     serviced the paste, and the clipboard cannot hold the transcript
///     indefinitely either.
///   * *An empty clipboard used to keep the transcript.* There was nothing to
///     save, so nothing was scheduled to put the clipboard back and the
///     dictation stayed there with no way off. `ClipboardUtil` now clears the
///     clipboard in that case, under the same changeCount guard, which is
///     measured too.
///   * *The app dying between the copy and the restore* leaves the transcript on
///     the clipboard with nothing scheduled to take it off. There is no
///     mitigation in this code: the restore is an in-process block with no
///     checkpoint, so a crash inside that 1.5 s window leaves the user's words in
///     a clipboard any application can read, and whatever they had copied gone.
///
///   What keeps this from being a silent default is the visibility, not the
///   design: `DeliveryPreference` is a control in Settings, its caption names
///   the target classes that get the clipboard, every dictation's log line
///   records `mechanism=clipboard-paste`, and "Keystrokes only" turns the path
///   off entirely. An independent judgment leaned the same way (0.63) — the
///   paste would ideally be opt-in per target family rather than switched on by
///   detection — which is not what ships: the captain's own case is a session
///   that gets no text at all without it, so the default fixes the reported
///   failure and the off-switch is one click away.
/// - **A ladder that prefers keystrokes and falls back at run time.** There is
///   nothing for a fallback to trigger on. Whether a target reconstructs from
///   key codes or takes the Unicode payload is a property of the target, and the
///   only observable on this side is the pasteboard the app wrote itself; a
///   guest that received nothing tells the host nothing about it. So the ladder
///   is decided *before* the events go out, from what the application in front
///   is, and `DeliveryPreference` is the user's override when the guess is
///   wrong.
///
/// # What is verified, and what is not
///
/// Verified on this side: the events a delivery posts, the shape of the pair,
/// what the Unicode field on each event reads back as, which mechanism the
/// ladder selects for a given application and preference, that the ⌘V pair is
/// posted, and that the pasteboard holds the transcript and gets its previous
/// contents back. That the text then *arrives* is verified for a native macOS
/// target, through a real `NSTextView` driven by AppKit's own key bindings.
///
/// Not verified, and not verifiable on this machine: what a virtual machine's
/// guest received. There is no guest in the test suite and nothing about the
/// guest is observable from the host — an independent judgment put "only
/// host-side transport can be tested in-process" at 0.65 against 0.34 for the
/// paste's transport being the one provable case, and both agree that guest
/// arrival is out of reach here. Proving it needs a capture inside the guest: a
/// dictation into a guest text field with the guest's own text dumped before and
/// after, or a trace of the host-side forwarding showing what the guest was
/// handed and what it typed back.
///
/// # The rule
///
/// Keystrokes by default, because that is the path that reaches every native
/// macOS application and keeps the clipboard untouched. The clipboard paste for
/// an application that redirects the input it receives into a session or another
/// machine — and this app can see that application: the frontmost bundle
/// identifier is read at delivery time, the same moment the interference watch
/// captures its target. That is what makes this a decision about a target rather
/// than a guess.
///
/// The rule has two tiers, and the difference between them is written down
/// because one of them is measured and the other is not: the bundle identifiers
/// measured on this machine (`verifiedRemoteClientBundleIdentifiers`) switch the
/// mechanism, while a vendor-prefix match (`remoteClientVendorPrefixes`) is a
/// judgement that an independent reading put at 0.36 and therefore does not
/// switch anything unless the user asks for it. `DeliveryPreference` overrides
/// the outcome either way.
