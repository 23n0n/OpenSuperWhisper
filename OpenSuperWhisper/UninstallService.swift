/// cannot delete the bundle it is running from, so this copies that script to a
/// temporary file, starts it detached with the app's own pid, and quits. The
/// script waits for that pid to disappear, then removes the app, the models the
/// package installed, the models the app downloaded and the installer receipt --
/// and keeps the recordings, the transcriptions database and the settings, which
/// is why the confirmation sheet lists both what goes and what stays.
